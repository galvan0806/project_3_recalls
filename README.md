### Project Overview
This project utilizes FDA data accessed via an API to cover recalls in the United States. The data is processed using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) techniques and loaded into MongoDB for analysis. We will employ various methods of visualization, including Java and Python libraries, to tell a compelling story about the recall data.

### Data Source
The data is sourced from the FDA's public API, specifically targeting food enforcement reports.

### Data Processing
1. **Extraction**: Data is extracted from the FDA API.
2. **Transformation**: The extracted data is cleaned and transformed into a suitable format for analysis.
3. **Loading**: The cleaned data is loaded into a MongoDB database.

### Visualization
We use a combination of Java and Python libraries to create visualizations that help in understanding the trends and patterns in the recall data. Some of the libraries used include:
- Matplotlib
- Plotly
- Leaflet

### Goals
- To provide insights into FDA recalls in the United States.
- To demonstrate the use of ETL processes in data analysis.
- To showcase various data visualization techniques.

### Data Visualization Track
For this track, our group will tell a story using data visualizations.

- The project includes visualizations created with:
  - Python (e.g., Matplotlib)
  - JavaScript (e.g., Leaflet)

- Data is stored in and extracted from MongoDB.

### Ethical Considerations
We have made efforts to ensure that the data used in this project is handled ethically and responsibly. This includes anonymizing any personal data and ensuring that the visualizations do not misrepresent the data.
